### Loading 3D Data

The process of loading 3D data is crucial for preparing the input for training, validation, and testing phases in medical image analysis. Here's a detailed explanation of how the data is handled in the `load_3D_data.py` script:

#### Data Splitting
The data is first split into training, validation, and testing sets based on predefined CSV files that list the filenames for each set. This is done in the `load_data` function:
- **Training Data**: A portion of the data specified by the CSV file. It is further split into training and validation sets based on a percentage (typically 80% training, 20% validation).
- **Testing Data**: Separate from the training data and used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

#### Class Weights Calculation
For imbalanced datasets, particularly common in medical imaging where certain conditions or features may be rare, class weights are computed to help the model learn from underrepresented classes effectively. This is handled by the `compute_class_weights` function, which calculates the weights based on the frequency of the classes in the training data.

#### Data Conversion
Data often needs to be converted into a format suitable for processing by neural networks. The `convert_data_to_numpy` function handles:
- Loading image and mask files.
- Ensuring they are in the correct dimensional format (3D).
- Optionally applying transformations or normalizations.
- Saving the processed data in a compressed `.npz` format for efficient loading during training.

#### Data Augmentation
To improve model robustness and provide more varied examples during training, data augmentation techniques are applied on-the-fly as batches are generated. This includes rotations, shifts, zooms, and other transformations to both images and masks, ensuring that the model can generalize well across varied data presentations.

#### Batch Generation
The `generate_train_batches`, `generate_val_batches`, and `generate_test_batches` functions are decorated with `@threadsafe_generator` to ensure that they can be used safely in a multi-threaded environment for batch processing.

These functions:
- Shuffle the data if required.
- Sequentially load and process images and masks from disk.
- Apply data augmentation.
- Yield batches of data in the shape required by the network, ensuring that each batch is consistent in size and shape.

This structured approach to data handling ensures that the model is trained on a well-prepared dataset, leading to better learning and generalization capabilities.
